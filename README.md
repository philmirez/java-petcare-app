IT 306 Pet Care Java App
===================


Introduction
-------------

This is the IT 306 Group Project repository, created by Phillip Ramirez and Usman Tahir. This repository contains the implementation for the Pet Care application assignment we were given, the document for which will also be included in the repository. The project has been developed in Java, with a build.xml file that is used for automated building and resource management for the project.

As the project takes shape, this README will be updated, with procedures on how to build and run the project, as well as other pertinent details.
